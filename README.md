### Stochastic Processes
**1.1** Definition: Given a probability space (Ω, ℱ , P), a stochastic process is any collection {X(t) ∶ t ∈ I} of random variables defined on this probability space, where I is an index set. The notations Xt and X(t) are used interchangeably to denote the value of the stochastic process at index value t.

**1.2** General Characteristics of Stochastic Processes
1.2.1 The Index Set I
The set I indexes and determines the type of stochastic process. This set can be quite general but here are some examples:
- If I = {0, 1, 2 …} or equivalent, we obtain the so-called discrete-time stochastic processes. We shall often write the process as {Xn}n∈ℕ in this case.
- If I = [0, ∞), we obtain the continuous-time stochastic processes. We shall write the process as {Xt}t≥0 in this case. Most of the time t represents time.
- The index set can be multidimensional. For example, with I = ℤ × ℤ, we may be describing a discrete random field where at any combination (x, y) ∈ I we have a value X(x, y) which may represent some node weights in a two-dimensional graph. If I = [0, 1]×[0, 1] we may be describing the structure of some surface where, for instance, X(x, y) could be the value of some electrical field intensity at position (x, y).

1.2.2 The State Space 𝒮
The state space is the domain space of all the random variables Xt. Since we are discussing about random variables and random vectors, then necessarily 𝒮 ⊆ ℝ or ℝn. Again, we have several important examples:
- If 𝒮 ⊆ ℤ, then the process is integer valued or a process with discrete state space.
- If 𝒮 = ℝ, then Xt is a real-valued process or a process with a continuous state space.
- If 𝒮 = ℝk, then Xt is a k-dimensional vector process.

The state space 𝒮 can be more general (for example, an abstract Lie algebra), in which case the definitions work very similarly except that for each t we have Xt measurable functions.

We recall that a real-valued function f defined on Ω is called measurable with respect to a sigma algebra ℱ in that space if the inverse image of set B, defined as f^−1(B) ≡ {𝜔 ∈ E ∶ f(𝜔) ∈ B)} is a set in sigma algebra ℱ , for all Borel sets B of ℝ.

A sigma algebra ℱ is a collection of sets F of Ω satisfying the following conditions:
1) ∅ ∈ ℱ.
2) If F ∈ ℱ then its complement Fc ∈ ℱ.
3) If F1, F2,… is a countable collection of sets in ℱ then their union
∪∞ n=1Fn ∈ ℱ

Suppose we have a random variable X defined on a space Ω. The sigma algebra
generated by X is the smallest sigma algebra in Ω that contains all the pre
images of sets in ℝ through X. That is,

𝜎(X) = 𝜎({X−1(B) ∣ for all BBorel sets in ℝ})

This abstract concept is necessary to make sure that we may calculate any probability
related to the random variable X.
