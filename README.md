### Stochastic Processes
1.1 Definition: Given a probability space (Ω, ℱ , P), a stochastic process is any collection {X(t) ∶ t ∈ I} of random variables defined on this probability space, where I is an index set. The notations Xt and X(t) are used interchangeably to denote the value of the stochastic process at index value t.


1.2 General Characteristics of Stochastic Processes

1.2.1 The Index Set I
The set I indexes and determines the type of stochastic process. This set can be quite general but here are some examples:
• If I = {0, 1, 2 …} or equivalent, we obtain the so-called discrete-time stochastic processes. We shall often write the process as {Xn}n∈ℕ in this case.
• If I = [0, ∞), we obtain the continuous-time stochastic processes. We shall write the process as {Xt}t≥0 in this case. Most of the time t represents time.
• The index set can be multidimensional. For example, with I = ℤ × ℤ, we may be describing a discrete random field where at any combination (x, y) ∈ I we have a value X(x, y) which may represent some node weights in a two-dimensional graph. If I = [0, 1]×[0, 1] we may be describing the structure of some surface where, for instance, X(x, y) could be the value of some electrical field intensity at position (x, y).
