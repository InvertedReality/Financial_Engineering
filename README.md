# `C++` & `Python` `Java` & `VBA` for Quantitative Finance

- The repository covers the following topics: asset pricing theory and its applications, financial optimization, market equilibrium,marketfrictions, dynamics trading strategies, risk management, and selected advanced topics in financial engineering and technology (`C++` & `Python` `Java` & `Visual Basic`).

### Asset Pricing Theory and Applications
-  Stochastic modeling in finance
    - State-space model
    - Securities market
    - Trading strategies
    - Complete markets and state prices
    - Arbitrage

#### Monte Carlo simulations
#### Arbitrage pricing
- Fundamental Theory of Asset Pricing (FTAP)
- Pricing by arbitrage
- State price density (SDP)
- Risk-neutral pricing
- Relating physical and risk-neutral probabilities
- Martingale

#### Continuous-time models
- Brownian motion
- Stochastic calculus
- Payoff and price processes in continuous-time
- Dynamic trading, replication and hedging in continuous-time
- FTAP in continuous-time
- Risk-neutral pricing in continuous-time

#### Applications
- Return, risk and dynamic trading
- Derivative pricing, hedging and replication
- Stochastic volatility
- Credit risk and pricing
- Interest rate models
- Linear factor models

### Financial Optimization
#### Expected utility theory
#### Consumption-saving/portfolio decisions
#### Dynamic programming
#### Optimal consumption-portfolio choices under complete markets
#### Optimal consumption-portfolio decision in continuous time
#### Optimization with constraints
#### Applications
- Dynamic portfolio choices
- Optimal order execution
- Optimal trading strategy with constraints: margin/leverage, draw-downs
- Asset-liability management

### Market Equilibrium (Wang)
#### Equilibrium analysis
#### Equilibrium asset-pricing models
- Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
- Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM)
- Consumption-based Capital Asset Pricing Model (CCAPM)
#### Applications
- Equilibrium models for interest rates (Cox-Ingersoll-Ross etc)
- Equilibrium implications on market leverage, asset allocation, risk premium and volatility

### Equilibrium Models with Frictions (Kogan)
#### Asymmetric information
- Rational expectations and market efficiency: Grossman-Stiglitz model
- Market micro-structure: Kyle model, Glosten-Milgrom model
#### Incomplete markets and constraints
- Liquidity risk
- Limits to arbitrage
- Heterogeneous beliefs and mispricing

### Dynamic Strategies and Market Frictions (Kogan)
#### Methodology: numerical approach to dynamic programming
#### Optimal order execution
#### Dynamic portfolio strategies with margin constraints and liquidity risk
#### Risk management: basis risk, liquidity risk
